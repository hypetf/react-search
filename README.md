## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/hypetf/testt/blob/main/preview.png)

I have created this very simple search bar with ReactJS and the main goal of this was to simply create a working search bar.<br/>
I do not recommend the used methods for big scaled projects and searches methods as it may affect the response time.
